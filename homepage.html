			<h3>Walking the beat with Los Angeles‚Äô Street Vet</h3>
			<a href="news4.html"><img src="img/newspic1.jpg" alt="Los Angeles' Street Vet picture" class="center"/></a>
			<p>Life on the streets can be extremely difficult for America‚Äôs homeless. Many are unsure where 
			they will sleep tonight or get their next meal. Some are mentally ill, others victims of dire 
			circumstance. In many cases, a pet is a homeless person‚Äôs only solace.According to a 2015 report in the journal, Child Psychiatry & Human Development, as many as 
			25 percent of the unhoused are pet owners. Though they deeply love their furry companions, 
			veterinary care is outside the financial reach of most homeless people, so their pets go without.
